# DDPM Implementation (Experiment Branch)

My DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model) implementation using PyTorch.

This project is developing... Just wait for that. ðŸ¤«

## Experiment

### Model Architecture

![model architecture](model.jpg)

The time encode, which was appeared in the second figure, is basically same to the Position Encoding in Tranformer.

### DDPM Hyperparameters

In order to simplify this experiment, I set:

Max time step `T = 100`.

Beta_t increasing linearly from `beta_1 = 1e-3` to `beta = 0.15`.

### Dataset

I use MNIST dataset to train my model.
