# 实验过程记录

最初自己写了一个模型，但是训练时一直不收敛😢，生成的都是噪声。
所以用MNIST试着做了一个小实验，结果模型只获取到了背景的黑色。

之后用别人的模型试了一次，实验很成功。😋

猜测是 Attention Block 写错了。

# Experiment Procedure Record

I wrote a model at first, but it never convergenced during training 😨, generated images are all noises.
So then I did a small experiment with MNIST, the model only obtained the black background though.

Later I tried one with someone else's model, then the experiment went very well. 🥵

I guess I went wrong on my Attention Block.
